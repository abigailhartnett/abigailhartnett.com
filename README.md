# Welcome to my portfolio bulid

I  began bulding this site on December 5, 2023. The purpose is, as you may have guessed, to offer easy access to my portfolio projects. 

My main goal with this build is to move quickly and iteratively. I'm beginning by putting the initial site functionality together and moving on from there.

✅ Step 1: gather resources internally

✅ Step 2: create a very basic site layout (see the [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/Ezg9o0ArU3lP0h18xg6pgF/AbigailHartnett.com?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=fuDKfADnAQCv1uHj-1))

✅ Step 3: set up that basic layout and component structure in React

✅ Step 4: connect links to resources

🚧 Step 5: finalize site functionality

Step 5: finalize copy

Step 6: finalize on-site design (to match my layouts)

From there, I'll begin to iterate. Feel free to poke around the repository and watch me build this site into something amazing! https://abigailhartnett.netlify.app/
