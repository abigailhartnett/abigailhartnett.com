        <p>
          I’ve always had a knack for systems. However, in my pursuit of
          inventing creative solutions for highly specific problems, I often
          found myself stretching the tools at my disposal to the limit.
        </p>

        <p>
          While this tinkering is super fun, cobbling together three distinct
          systems to address a single issue frequently results in a solution
          more more elaborate than the problem required, making it just as
          problematic in the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was time to stop making do with what I had and start making tools
          of my own. That’s how I stepped into front-end development, and I
          haven’t looked back.
        </p>
